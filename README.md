<p> Library Application <br />
<br /> People who have a great number of books in their home libraries, could really use an application to help them store information about all the books they own. <br />
<br /> Application should include an intuitive UI, with a possibility to search books, or filter them from database. Each book could have information such as name, author, publisher, year of publishing, photo, language, status (borrowed or not), person who borrowed it, and perhaps some additional notes. There is a possibility that some of the fields will be added during the work on a project. <br />
<br /> There should be a login panel, where only admin user should have an access to the application. To extend the project, there is a possiblity that some additional roles will be added, such as Readers - people who could log in to see books, but would not be able to edit any information about the books. Perhaps those users could have special option such as sending a request for changes in book information/request for borowing, to admin user (admin could receive emails for this), but it is not confirmed at this point. <br />
<br /> Furthermore, there could be a possibility to add ratings to the books, or write reviews, connect quotes to books etc. Some of the features might be added during the work on the application. <p/><br />
